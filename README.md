# 42_so_long
* The aim of this project is to create a small 2D game where players have to pick up all collectables and go to the exit; then you WIN!

Compile with:
```shell
make
```
or
```shell
** make bonus ** 
--> this is better, trust me :->
```
<hr>

Execute with:
```shell
./so_long_bonus maps/name_of_a_map.ber
```

### Maps
The game is able to play any map you want as long as it follow some specific rules:
* The map has to be a ``.ber`` file.
* It can only contain some of the following characters:

| Character | Object |
| - | - |
| 1 | Wall. |
| 0 | Empty space. |
| C | Collectable. |
| E | Exit. |
| P | Player starting position. |
| H | Horizontal enemy. It moves to left and right, changing direction when its path is blocked. |
| V | Vertical enemy. Moving up and down. |
| F | Following enemy. Each move tries to get closer to the player |

* The map must be a rectangle surrounded by walls â€˜1â€™.
* It must have at least one exit â€˜Eâ€™ and one collectable â€˜Câ€™. And only one player â€˜Pâ€™.

---> see some examples in the ``maps/`` folder of this project.

### Testing

Try a wrong map in the directory map/ inside the 42_so_long dir. For Example:
```shell
** ./so_long_bonus maps/map_err1.ber **
```
if everything works fine a message like this will appear:

```
ðŸ›‘ERROR:
The E/C is unreachable.
```
if you want you can try with your own map, find out how here:
